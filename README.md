# OpenGoal-Mod-Base
Serves as a base template for openGOAL mods that will be supported via [OG-ModLauncher](https://github.com/OpenGOAL-Mods/OG-ModLauncher).

- Please ensure you are not committing copyrighted material to your repo (the `.gitignore` should help prevent this). 
- Generally speaking you should only be updating certain directories/files:
  - GOAL code (`/goal_src`)
  - Assets specific to the PC Port (`/game/assets/jak1/`, `/custom_assets/`)
  - The executable binaries (`/out/build/Release/goalc.exe`, `/out/build/Release/gk.exe`, `/out/build/Release/extractor.exe`)
  - Decompiler config (`/decompiler/config`)

## Custom Navmesh Implementation and Example

LuminarLight made changes that allow placing custom navmesh into Jak 1 levels. This will hopefully become useless one day, if proper navmesh support is ever added to OpenGOAL.

The navmesh system in Jak II is more advanced, I haven't managed to figure it out yet.

### Getting Started

Please keep in mind that you are expected to be familiar with custom levels and GOAL. Still, I tried to make things as understandable as possible.

I would recommend copying an existing navmesh as a start. You can use the inspect method I made. The actor whose navmesh you want to copy must be loaded. Example:
`(inspect (-> (the-as entity-actor (entity-by-name "snow-bunny-55")) nav-mesh))`

You should change the origin and bounds, depending on where you want to place your navmesh.

I usually just remove the nodes, because I do not understand it and things seem fine without it. But keep in mind that every navmesh that is in the game has at least one node.

We do not understand route, but it is needed - otherwise game will crash. If you copy an existing navmesh, the route data is copied correctly. But since we don't understand it, for fully custom navmesh we can never have proper route data. Correct route data is essential if you want to take advantage of gap triangles (where enemies jump).

You can make multiple enemies use the same navmesh. To do this, create the navmesh through code for the first actor, like in the example. And for the other actors, add a lump that tells the game to use another actor's navmesh. Reference is by aid. Example: `"nav-mesh-actor": ["uint32", 40000]`. Tip: You can do the same thing with paths, using the `path-actor` lump.

If the game crashes when you approach a custom navmesh, make sure you added `:custom-hacky? #t` to your custom navmesh definition. If that is there, then check if the actor has a path. It needs a path.

If something is still unclear, please look at the code. I added a lot of comments.

### Final Words

I am not an expert at decompiling, so my methods were not the most efficient. But with a lot of time, I managed to figure things out. There are probably people who could do this a lot better than me. Hopefully it will happen.

Also, I know my inspect method is not perfect. But it is very tedious to write such a thing, so I just included what we really need. And I think the nodes part could use a cleanup.

I am happy if anyone finds this useful. But I have a request: If you learn more about navmeshes, especially things that would benefit other modders as well, please let me know. And maybe we will add it to this branch.

## Project Description

The project's goal is to port the original trilogy (Jak 1 -> Jak 3) to PC. Over 98% of the games were written in GOAL, a custom LISP language developed by Naughty Dog. Our strategy is:
- decompile the original game code into human-readable GOAL code
- develop our own compiler for GOAL and recompile the game code for x86-64
- create a tool to extract game assets into formats that can be easily viewed or modified
- create tools to repack game assets into a format that our port uses.

Our objectives are:
- make the port a "native application" on x86-64, with high performance. It shouldn't be emulated, interpreted, or transpiled.
- Our GOAL compiler's performance should be around the same as unoptimized C.
- try to match things from the original game and development as possible. For example, the original GOAL compiler supported live modification of code while the game is running, so we do the same, even though it's not required for just porting the game.
- support modifications. It should be possible to make edits to the code without everything else breaking.

At the moment we support **x86_64** on Windows, Linux and macOS (via Rosetta translation).  There are no plans to ever make a mobile release.

### Current Status

- Jak 1 has been considered in a polished, complete state for years at this point.
- Jak 2 is considered in beta due to a few issues we are aware of that need fixing, however to the casual user, the game is essentially complete.
- Jak 3 has a good amount of work left to do.

### Methodology

To assist with decompiling, we've built a decompiler that can process GOAL code and unpack game assets. We manually specify function types and locations where we believe the original code had type casts (or where they feel appropriate) until the decompilation succeeds, then we clean up the output of the decompiled code by adding comments and adjusting formatting, then save it in `goal_src/`.

Our decompiler is designed specifically for processing the output of the original GOAL compiler. As a result, when given correct casts, it often produces code that can be directly fed into a compiler and works perfectly. This is continually tested as part of our unit tests.

## Setting up a Development Environment

The remainder of this README is aimed at people interested in building the project from source, typically with the intention of contributing as a developer.

If this does not sound like you and you just want to play the game, refer to the above section [Quick Start](#quick-start)

### OS Setup

- [Windows](/docs/setup/system/windows.md)
- [Linux](/docs/setup/system/linux.md)
- [MacOS](/docs/setup/system/macos.md)
- [Docker](/docs/setup/system/docker.md)

### Editor Setup

You can of course use whatever editor you want, but here is some documentation that should help you get started on some of the editor's we have used and have written about:

- [Visual Studio (Windows)](/docs/setup/dev/vs.md)
- [Visual Studio Code](/docs/setup/dev/vscode.md)
- [Zed](/docs/setup/dev/zed.md)

### Building and Running the Game

Getting a running game involves 4 main steps:

1. Build C++ tools (follow Getting Started steps above for your platform)
2. Extract assets from the game
3. Build the game
4. Run the game

#### Extract Assets

First, we have to setup our environment so we know which game and version we are operating with. For the black label version of Jak 1 we would run the following:

```sh
task set-game-jak1
task set-decomp-ntscv1 # or for example for PAL, `task set-decomp-pal`
```

> Run `task --list` to see the other available options

Next, ensure you extract your ISO file contents into the relevant `iso_data/<game-name>` folder.  In the case of Jak 1 this is `iso_data/jak1`.

Once this is done, open a terminal in the `jak-project` folder and run the following:

```sh
task extract
```

#### Build the Game (Running the Compiler)

The next step is to build the game itself.  To do so, in the same terminal run the following:

```sh
task repl
```

You will be greeted with a prompt like so:

```sh
 _____             _____ _____ _____ __
|     |___ ___ ___|   __|     |  _  |  |
|  |  | . | -_|   |  |  |  |  |     |  |__
|_____|  _|___|_|_|_____|_____|__|__|_____|
      |_|
Welcome to OpenGOAL 0.8!
Run (repl-help) for help with common commands and REPL usage.
Run (lt) to connect to the local target.

g >
```

Run the following to build the game:

```sh
g > (mi)
```

> IMPORTANT NOTE! If you're not using the non-default version of the game, you may hit issues trying to run `(mi)` in this step. An example error might include something like:
>
> `Input file iso_data/jak1/MUS/TWEAKVAL.MUS does not exist.`
>
> This is because the decompiler inputs/outputs using the `gameName` JSON field in the decompiler config. For example if you are using Jak 1 PAL, it will assume `iso_data/jak1_pal` and `decompiler_out/jak1_pal`.  Therefore, you can inform the REPL/compiler of this via the `gameVersionFolder` config field described [here](./goal_src/user/README.md)

#### Run the Game

Finally the game can be launched.  Open a second terminal from the `jak-project` directory and run the following:

```sh
task boot-game
```

The game should boot automatically if everything was done correctly.

##### Connecting the REPL to the Game

Connecting the REPL to the game allows you to inspect and modify code or data while the game is running.

To do so, in the REPL after a successful `(mi)`, run the following:

```sh
g > (lt)
```

If successful, your prompt should change to:

```sh
gc>
```

For example, running the following will print out some basic information about Jak:

```sh
gc> *target*
```

##### Running the Game Without Auto-Booting

You can also start up the game without booting.  To do so run the following in one terminal

```sh
task run-game
```

And then in your REPL run the following (after a successful `(mi)`):

```sh
g > (lt)
[Listener] Socket connected established! (took 0 tries). Waiting for version...
Got version 0.8 OK!
[Debugger] Context: valid = true, s7 = 0x147d24, base = 0x2123000000, tid = 2438049

```
